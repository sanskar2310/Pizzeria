# Pizzeria
🍕 Pizzeria is a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) food ordering web application that allows users to browse pizzas, customize toppings, manage a cart, and place orders. The project focuses on RESTful APIs, MongoDB data modeling with Mongoose, and a responsive Angular frontend, simulating a real-world pizza ordering system.
