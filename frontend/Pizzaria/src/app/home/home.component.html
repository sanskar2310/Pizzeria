            <p class="Medium">We believe in good. We launched Fresh Pan Pizza Best Excuse Awards on our Facebook fan page.
                Fans were given situations where they had to come up with wacky and fun excuses. The person with the best
                excuse won the Best Excuse Badge and won Pizzeria's vouchers. Their enthusiastic response proved that
                Pizzeria's Fresh Pan Pizza is the Tastiest Pan Pizza. Ever!

            <p class="Medium"> Ever since we launched the Tastiest Pan Pizza, ever, people have not been able to resist the
                softest, cheesiest, crunchiest, butteriest Domino's Fresh Pan Pizza. They have been leaving the stage in the
                middle of a performance and even finding excuses to be disqualified in a football match.

            <p class="medium text-justify" >We're ruthless about goodness. We have no qualms about tearing up a day-old
            lettuce leaf (straight from the farm), or steaming a baby carrot. Cut. Cut. Chop. Chop. Steam. Steam. Stir. Stir.
            </p>

            <p class="small text-start">While they're still young and fresh — that's our motto. It makes the kitchen
            a better place, filled with passion, precision, and care. Every ingredient is selected to bring you the best flavor and quality.

            every detail. Their commitment to quality and consistency ensures that every bite delivers comfort, satisfaction, and unforgettable taste.
            </p>
